# Java2DGameEngine

A tank game written from using java's vast library.
Done so with the purpose to learn graphics rendering, game logic, sound management, and network management.
The game is meant to be open source, so anyone can chime in if a certain feature is wished for.

The game is built with maven. To build the game yourself run
cd to/java/tank/game
mvn install package
Which will create a shapshot in the target folder.
Run the .jar file and the game will run.

And to run it type
java -jar ./target/JavaTankGame1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
